# FirefoxOS GeoTracker

Started at the FirefoxOS hackathon at Mozilla Paris, 06/09/2013.

## Goals

Creating a general purpose GPS track recording/exporting app, similar to My Tracks by Google on Android, and giving it an OpenStreetMap twist by allowing the user to add pre-formated/tagged info along the way.

## TODO:

1. GPX export to SD card (requires privileged app level)
2. All the rest!
